### Design collaboration

In our workshop, we:
* Analyzed the constraints of our current keyword search functions

### Important decisions

We decided to implement the following quick wins:
* Implement elastic search for professions
* Adding keywords field to professions
* Move sector filters above nations for professions
* Improve the wordings when there's no search results for professions
