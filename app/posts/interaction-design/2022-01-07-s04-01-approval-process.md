## Overview 

We built a the approval process into our prototype according to the suggested plan from Alpha. However, in the design collaborations, we believe the approval process will cause more confusion to users.

### Process map

We have designed the editing journeys (both professions and regulators) by including the approval process of the Alpha process map.

### Workshop

In the prototype review from our design collaboration, we found that it may not be helpful to ask members of central admin to create and edit regulator's information, especially when they are onboarding new regulators. It is because central admin may not be the one who is most familiar with the information (e.g. judging if the address is correct) for these regulators.

Also, we found that there could be a lot of issues found during the back and forth:
* Should central admin receive notifications from RPR for new amendments? 
* What if central admin do not approve the amendments? How should rejection work?
* Which member of regulator users should receive notifications when the amendment is accepted or rejected?

Our conclusion is that the process is complicated and it may not be helpful. We need a way to streamline the process.
