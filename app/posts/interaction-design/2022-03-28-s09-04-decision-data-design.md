## Overview 

We had a couple of design collaborations to kick start the recognition decision data works. Although we could not agree with a final design, we made some progress and important decisions.

### Alpha design

We had a review on the requirements from the Alpha materials, including the process map and a process statment.

### Design collaboration and provocations

We reviewed the Alpha prototype, UKCPQ sample data and some proposed spreadsheet together first, and then provided a set of design provocations to see which direction is closer to what we want. The directions include:

* A separate recognition decision data section
* Integrating into the editing journey
* A CSV upload / download approach (CSV in, CSV out)
* Web interface approach (UI in, UI out)

### Primary directions

After exploring all possible options, the team preferred:
* a UI in, UI + CSV out approach
* an approach that separates the updating of main content and decision data
