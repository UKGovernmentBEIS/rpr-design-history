## Overview 

Approving `professions creation` is a separate story from UKCPQ approver. We decided: 

* not to build it for now
* new professions will be approved automatically

It will remain the same until we build the approval process.

The design is on this [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lkEVwtI=/?moveToWidget=3458764514454934670&cot=14).
