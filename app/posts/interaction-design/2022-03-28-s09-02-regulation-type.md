## Overview 

We are adding Regulation Types to professions and its listing page. There are two drivers for adding this filter:

* Policy analysts may need to filter certain types of regulating organisations in response to new legislation and
* Ministers have committed to keeping a public list of legally regulated (licensed) professions

### Regulation type

Professions on the register may be regulated in three ways:
* **Licensing** - By law, only recognised professionals can carry out the reserved activities
* **Certification** - There are no restrictions on activity, but only certified professionals can use the title
* **Accreditation** - Voluntary professional status, with designated titles but no restrictions on activity
