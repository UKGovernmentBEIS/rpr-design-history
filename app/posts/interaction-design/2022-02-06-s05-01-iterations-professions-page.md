## Overview 

We tested the profession's page with regulators and professionals and then further iterated the page.

### User research findings

Some of the findings about content on profession's page include:
* Not clear how to show professions with reserved activities that require separate qualification
* Not clear how to provide or see different routes to qualification
* Regulators and professionals expected to see clear summaries and onward links
* Long and narrow text blocks are hard to read

### Design collaborations

We had a collaborations on the content structure of the page:
* discussed professions that have separate certification with different reserved activities
* whether to have separate professions or describe within one profession
* service should support both
