## Overview 

After the [RPR user roles and permissions workshop](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lhMpw6c=/?moveToWidget=3074457368199043890&cot=14), Marianne, Morrighan and Ming came together and re-designed the "users creation" journey and decided to split it into three parts according the user's role.

The three journeys are for:
* National admin
* BEIS admin or UKCPQ admin (both are organisation admin)
* Regulatory authorities admin (organisation admin))

Our devs will iterate the single users design into this one when we get a chance.

The design is on this [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lkEVwtI=/?moveToWidget=3458764513942745062&cot=14).
