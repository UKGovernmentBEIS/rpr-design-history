## Overview 

After the RPR user roles and permissions workshop, Marianne, Morrighan and Ming came together and re-designed the "users creation" journey and decided to split it into three parts according the user's role.

The three journeys are for:
* National admin
* BEIS admin or UKCPQ admin (both are organisation admin)
* Regulatory authorities admin (organisation admin))

Our devs will iterate the single users design into this one when we get a chance.
