## Overview 

There is no delete / archive button at the moment. We have the archive button in the prototype but no complete design of the archiving mechanism.

### Design collaboration

In our collaborations, we decided to:
* Add the archive button back
* Keep all archived items (professions / regulators / users) in the internal search / listing page, but filtered out by default
* Use the new Status filter to show all archived items
* Archived items will be viewable only. Restoring archived posts is not yet allowed
