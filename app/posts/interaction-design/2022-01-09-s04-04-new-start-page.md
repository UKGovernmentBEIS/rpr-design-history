  title: New start page for the public facing side
  date: 2022-01-11

## Overview 

We have a simpler starting page for the service. 

--- 

### New start page

The page has a brief explanation of regulated professions. And direct links to the different parts of the service.

### User research findings

The new starting page worked well:
* The title felt appropriate for the service and what it provides.
* The onward links were clear.
* But ‘annual figures’ was less relevant and should be less prominent.
