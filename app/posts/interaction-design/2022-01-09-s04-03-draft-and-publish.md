  title: Draft and Publish to replace the original approval process
  date: 2022-01-09

## Overview 

As part of our scoping discussions we’d agreed to replace a handed off approval step with a first iteration of self-publishing by regulators of edits, locking down creation and deletion of regulators and professions to the central organisation, and letting the central organisation see an audit trail of draft and published changes.

### Draft and publish - regulators

We have a new design for managing regulators, including:
* Creating a new regulator
* Editing regulator details
* Publishing the new regulator
* Editing an existing regulator
* Publishing changes to a regulator

All those things are necessary, but we expect them to be used quite rarely

We’ll be talking about permissions later, but it’s worth noting that only people in the central organisation will be able to do the first one.

### Draft and publish - professions

Similarly, we have a new design for managing professions, including:
* Creating a new profession
* Editing the profession details
* Publishing the new profession
* Editing an existing profession
* Publishing changes to the profession

Again, all those things are necessary, but we don’t expect them to be used that often.

Again, only people in the central organisation will be able to do the first one.

### Draft and publish - summary

These flows are based on being able to save changes as drafts and then publish those changes when you’re ready and on having an audit trail of changes to regulators and professions.

Drafts will be visible to all users in the relevant regulator, and visible to users in the central organisation so you can have others review changes.
But central approval is no longer mandatory.

The audit trail means you can see when regulator and profession details are drafted and published, and who is making those changes.

All of this will be particularly useful in a more significant structural change to regulation when you might need to make and review several related changes.
